java-otp is a library for generating one-time passwords using the [HOTP (RFC 4226)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) or [TOTP (RFC 6238)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) standards in Java.

## System requirements

java-otp works with Java 8 or newer. If you need support for versions of Java older than Java 8, you may try using java-otp v0.1 (although it is no longer supported).

## Usage

To demonstrate generating one-time passwords, we'll focus on the TOTP algorithm. To create a TOTP generator with a default password length (6 digits), time step (30 seconds), and HMAC algorithm (HMAC-SHA1):

```java
final TimeBasedOneTimePasswordGenerator totp = new TimeBasedOneTimePasswordGenerator();
```

To actually generate time-based one-time passwords, you'll need a secret key and a timestamp. Secure key management is beyond the scope of this document; for the purposes of an example, though, we'll generate a random key:

```java
final Key key;
{
    final KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance(totp.getAlgorithm());

    // HMAC-SHA1 and HMAC-SHA256 prefer 64-byte (512-bit) keys; HMAC-SHA512 prefers 128-byte (1024-bit) keys
    keyGenerator.init(512);

    key = keyGenerator.generateKey();
}
```

Armed with a secret key, we can deterministically generate one-time passwords for any timestamp:

```java
final Date now = new Date();
final Date later = new Date(now.getTime() + totp.getTimeStep(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS));

System.out.format("Current password: %06d\n", totp.generateOneTimePassword(key, now));
System.out.format("Future password:  %06d\n", totp.generateOneTimePassword(key, later));
```

â€¦which produces (for one randomly-generated key):

```
Current password: 164092
Future password:  046148
```
